Here's what the code does, step by step:

It waits for the "DOMContentLoaded" event to ensure the DOM is ready for manipulation.

Once the DOM is ready, it selects an HTML element with the id of 'mobile-container'. This element acts as a container for other elements that will be added dynamically.

It sets a variable circleDiameter to 50, which is used to define the size of a circular element that will be created.

It creates a new div element, stored in the variable projectile.

It sets various style properties on the projectile:

Sets its width and height to circleDiameter (50px in this case).
Gives it a blue background color.
Makes it round by setting its border radius to 50%.
Positions it absolutely within its parent container.
Centers it horizontally by setting its left property to 50% and transforming it along the X-axis by -50%.
Positions it 70px from the bottom of its parent container.
Finally, it appends the newly created projectile div to the container.

The result of this code would be a blue circle, 50 pixels in diameter, appearing horizontally centered and 70 pixels from the bottom of the '#mobile-container' element. This circle is styled to look like a projectile or a larger blue dot.
